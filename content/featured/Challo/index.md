Inspired by the Indian Himalayas rich biodiversity, this project employs design thinking to tackle the existing social and environmental issues. With this goal in mind, we encourage conservation and research efforts, promote eco-tourism, and improve local livelihoods in the region.

This project has won the NUS Enterprise NUS Alumni Start-up Catalyst award, as well as 2nd runner up for CS3217 in the 18th NUS School of Computing Term Project Showcase ([STePS](https://uvents.nus.edu.sg/event/18th-steps))
